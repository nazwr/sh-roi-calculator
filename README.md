# ROI Calculator Template

## Setup

- npm install
- npm start

## Configuration

- The tables are all populated and built off of the /src/calculator_data.json file - this is the place to update any and all information that is currently being shown in the calculator.
- To add new roles to the application, duplicate a role object in the JSON object, fill out with the appropriate title, a short lookup abbreviaton, and the job questions to show. The table will support any number of these - it doesn't have to be 3.
